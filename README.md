# Sex-Related Differences in Toxicities caused by Treatment of Advanced Melanoma Patients
[Publication](https://osf.io/3t6fk/)

This project presents a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at investigating sex-based differences in the manifestation of adverse events (AEs) caused by modern treatments for advanced melanoma, specifically immunotherapy and targeted therapy. These therapies have transformed the prognosis of melanoma patients, yet they are frequently associated with toxicities that can impact treatment adherence and quality of life. Prior studies suggested that female patients may be at higher risk of AEs under cytotoxic therapies. The primary objective of this meta-analysis is to determine whether sex significantly influences the occurrence of side effects from immunotherapy and targeted therapy, thereby allowing clinicians to optimize treatment strategies and enhance patient quality of life.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Embase, including all independent studies published up to April 2024 that reported sex-specific toxicity data in patients with melanoma as the primary disease. Data extraction focused on obtaining sufficient information to estimate Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), or raw data on male and female patients with or without AEs. Due to limited availability of general AE data, the analysis focused on specific categories such as dermatologic, thyroid-related, and grade III–IV AEs.
Statistical analysis was performed using random-effects models to calculate summary odds ratios (sORs) and corresponding CIs. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic, and publication bias was evaluated via Egger’s and Begg’s tests. Sensitivity analyses, including leave-one-out methods, were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity.

Key findings revealed significant sex-related differences in treatment toxicity:
- Female patients exhibited a higher risk of developing thyroid-related adverse events.
- Women were also more likely to experience dermatologic and grade III–IV toxicities.
- Specifically, for dermatologic AEs, the sOR was 1.31 (95% CI [1.06–1.61]), indicating a significantly greater risk for females.
- Heterogeneity was not significant for thyroid AEs (I² = 29.39%), and moderate for dermatologic AEs.
- No significant evidence of publication bias was found for the analyzed AE categories.

This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on sex-specific responses to advanced melanoma therapies. It is one of the first to systematically examine modern treatments through this lens and confirms that female sex is associated with a higher likelihood of certain adverse events. These results emphasize the relevance of statistical and machine learning models in biomedical research and support the inclusion of sex-based considerations in clinical decision-making and future studies.
Limitations include the retrospective nature of the analysis and the limited ability to extract general AE data from many studies, which constrained the analysis to specific toxicity categories.
 (All the statistical analisys were performed using R.)
